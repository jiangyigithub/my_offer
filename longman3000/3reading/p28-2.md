Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
Goal setting `suffers from` a serious case of `survivorship bias`. We
`concentrate` on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and
mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while
overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t
succeed.
Every `Olympian` wants to win a `gold medal`. Every candidate wants
to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the
same goals, then the goal cannot be what `differentiates` the winners
from the losers. It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that
`propelled` the `British cyclists` to the top of the sport. `Presumably`, they
had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other
professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when
they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that
they achieved a different outcome.
