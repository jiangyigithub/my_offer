Estimates of the sacrifice ratio suggest that reducing inflation by 1 percentage point requires giving up about 5 percent of one year’s output. Reducing inflation from, say, 4 percent to zero requires a loss of 20 percent of a year’s output. People might dislike inflation of 4 percent, but it is not at all clear that they would (or should) be willing to pay 20 percent of a year’s income to get rid of it.
