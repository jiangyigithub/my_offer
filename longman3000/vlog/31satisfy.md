**sensitive** 
You may have noticed that prices often end in .99. In some ways,this phenomenon is odd. Why charge $4.99, instead of an even $5.00? If people were truly rational, sellers wouldn’t have a good reason to focus on
prices ending in .99. But in fact, it turns out that sellers are smart for using this approach to pricing. Various studies suggest that buyers are excessively sensitive to a price’s left-most digit. Even though $4.99 is only one penny less than $5.00, buyers may not perceive it that way. Because adding the extra penny changes the left-most digit from a 4 to a 5, the change may exert a surprisingly large impact on consumer behavior. An irrational focus on the left-most digit is called left-digit bias.
