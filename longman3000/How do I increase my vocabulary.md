I think anyone who's learining a new language has this question:
How do I increase my vocabulary?
How do i do it in a shorter  period of time?
Now if you watched my videos before,
you know I don't advocate for memory.
I don't recommend using rote memory to build a foundation of vacabulary.
To me that's incredibly ineffective and a waste of time.
With that said,I'm going to teach you how to increase your vacabulary.
in a shorter period of time,
and most importantly,not forget.
So if you want to find out more, stay tuned.

When it comes to studying vocabulary,quality trumps quantity.
The problem with staring at a vocabulary list
hoping you'd rememeber all these words is that
you don't actually understand these words,
so you're just staring at one-world simple translation.
You're just translating it and sometimes it's not even accurate.
Words are not dead.
They have phrases,
they are used differntly in different contexts.
So you have to study the words carefully.
Especially when it comes to abstract words.
You know, there are actually two kinds of words,
one is abstract , the other one is real-world.
Abstract words mean "happy" "sad",
words that you can't touch.
It's a concept, it's abstract.
And real-world words are things like books,colors and sky.
You know, it's a physical concrete object.
Or at least something that we could easily translate to chinese.
Like oxygen.

Today I'm mainly focusing on abstract words.
