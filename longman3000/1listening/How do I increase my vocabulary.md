## warm-up
I think anyone who's learning a new language has this question:
How do I increase my vocabulary?
How do i do it in a shorter  period of time?
Now if you watched my videos before,
you know I don't advocate for memory.
I don't recommend using rote memory to build a foundation of vocabulary.
To me that's incredibly ineffective and a waste of time.
With that said,I'm going to teach you how to increase your vocabulary.
in a shorter period of time,
and most importantly,not forget.
So if you want to find out more, stay tuned.

When it comes to studying vocabulary,quality trumps quantity.
The problem with staring at a vocabulary list
hoping you'd remember all these words is that
you don't actually understand these words,
so you're just staring at one-world simple translation.
You're just translating it and sometimes it's not even accurate.
Words are not dead.
They have phrases,
they are used differently in different contexts.
So you have to study the words carefully.
Especially when it comes to abstract words.
You know, there are actually two kinds of words,
one is abstract , the other one is real-world.
Abstract words mean "happy" "sad",
words that you can't touch.
It's a concept, it's abstract.
And real-world words are things like books,colors and sky.
You know, it's a physical concrete object.
Or at least something that we could easily translate to chinese.
Like oxygen.

Today I'm mainly focusing on abstract words.


## No.1 Study within a range.Or within a certain frequency.
Words have different levels, and different rates of frequency.
You don't want to read beyond your level,you don't want to study the words that are not that frequent or not that common in your everyday life just yet.
For beginners, you need to stick to the 3000 words first.
You can find these words everywhere.
You can google it. You can baidu it.
You can look up the words in Longman Dictionary and see if it's labeled 3 or 2.

## No.2 Study abstract words first.
A lot of us dragged into identifying objects at the beginning when you first started learning English.
We would spend so much time on words like Friday,colors,a girl,a boy
I think those things aren't necessarily useful when it comes to conversions.
When we're in the scenario we can easily identify an object.
but when we just focus on those words,
and not actually learn how to put those words together,
how to construct phrases and sentences using abstract words.
It doesn't actually do us any good.
And it's not relevant to our everyday life. and therefore we forget.
And even if we remember,
Just knowing words like Monday,Friday,red,blue,yellow doesn't get us anywhere.

## No.3 Read bilingual materials.
That's anything from textbooks with translation of course,
TV shows with Chinese and English subtitles or English song with translations.
You want to read bilingual materials.
beacuse you can quickly identify what the word means.
and you know,that's gonna save your time
because you don't have to look up the world.

## No.4 Study the words and take notes.
After you get a good idea of the general concept.
you wanna go back and study the words individually.
and study it carefully and extensively.
And when you do that,you wanna loop up the words in the dictionary 
See how it 's used in phrase/ sentences.
And take notes if it's necessary.
When you're taking notes,you're actually repeating the words.
You're actually saying the words in your head.So it gives you more exposure.
It gives you more repetition.
Therefor you have a higer chances of 
rememobering the words the next time you hear it.

## No.5 Have constant and consistent exposure to English.
Don't memorize the vocubulary,but you can't just read and call it a day.
The second day you have to repeat whatever you did the day before.
Make sure you're studying English at least 10 minutes a day.
to build up the habit first.
The more you repeat,the more exposure you have to English
the easier it is for you to memorize random words.
because you'll see words pop up again and again.
And you'll remeber multiple words all at once.
because they're related and interconnected.
