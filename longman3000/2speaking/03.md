Principle 3: `Rational` People Think at the `Margin`

`Economists` normally assume that people are rational. 

Rational people `systematically` and `purposefully` do the best they can to achieve their objectives, 
given the available opportunities. 

As you study `economics`, you will encounter `firms` that 
decide how many workers to hire and how much of their product to manufacture 
and sell to `maximize` profits. 

You will also encounter individuals who decide 
how much time to spend working and what goods and services to buy with the `resulting` income 
to achieve the highest possible `level` of satisfaction.

`Rational` people know that decisions in life are `rarely` black and white 
but usually `involve` `shades` of gray. 

At dinnertime, the question you face is not “Should I fast or eat like a pig?” 

More likely, you will be asking yourself “Should I take that `extra` `spoonful` of `mashed` potatoes?” 

When `exams` roll around, your decision is not between blowing them off and studying twenty-four hours a day but whether to spend an extra hour reviewing your `notes` instead of watching TV. 

Economists use the term marginal change to `describe` a small incremental `adjustment` to an `existing` plan of action. 

Keep in mind that margin means “edge,” 
so marginal changes are adjustments around the `edges` of what you are doing. 

Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.

For example, `suppose` you are considering `calling` a friend on your cell phone.

You decide that talking with her for 10 `minutes` would give you a benefit that you value at about $7. 

Your cell phone service costs you $40 `per` month plus $0.50 per
minute for whatever `calls` you make. 

You usually talk for 100 `minutes` a month,so your total monthly bill is $90 ($0.50 per minute times 100 minutes, plus the $40 `fixed` fee). 

Under these `circumstances`, should you make the call? 

You might be tempted to `reason` as follows: “Because I pay $90 for 100 `minutes` of `calling` each month, the average minute on the phone costs me $0.90. 

So a 10-minute call costs $9. 

Because that $9 cost is greater than the $7 benefit, 
I am going to `skip` the call.” 

That conclusion is wrong, however. 

Although the average cost of a 10-minute call is $9, the marginal cost—the amount your bill increases if you make the extra call—is only $5. 

You will make the right decision only by comparing the marginal benefit and the marginal cost. 

Because the marginal benefit of $7 is greater than the marginal cost of $5, you should make the call. 

This is a principle that people `innately` understand: Cell phone users with unlimited minutes(that is, minutes that are free at the margin) are often `prone` to make long and `frivolous` calls.
