Principle 3: `Rational` People Think at the `Margin`

`Economists` normally assume that people are rational. 

Rational people `systematically` and `purposefully` do the best they can to achieve their objectives, 
given the available opportunities. 

As you study `economics`, you will encounter `firms` that 
decide how many workers to hire and how much of their product to manufacture 
and sell to `maximize` profits. 

You will also encounter individuals who decide 
how much time to spend working and what goods and services to buy with the `resulting` income 
to achieve the highest possible `level` of satisfaction.
