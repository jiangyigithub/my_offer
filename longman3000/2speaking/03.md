Principle 3: `Rational` People Think at the `Margin`

`Economists` normally assume that people are rational. 

Rational people `systematically` and `purposefully` do the best they can to achieve their objectives, 
given the available opportunities. 

As you study `economics`, you will encounter `firms` that 
decide how many workers to hire and how much of their product to manufacture 
and sell to `maximize` profits. 

You will also encounter individuals who decide 
how much time to spend working and what goods and services to buy with the `resulting` income 
to achieve the highest possible `level` of satisfaction.

Rational people know that decisions in life are `rarely` black and white 
but usually `involve` `shades` of gray. 

At dinnertime, the question you face is not “Should I fast or eat like a pig?” 

More likely, you will be asking yourself “Should I take that `extra` `spoonful` of `mashed` potatoes?” 

When `exams` roll around, your decision is not between blowing them off and studying twenty-four hours a day but whether to spend an extra hour reviewing your notes instead of watching TV. 

Economists use the term marginal change to `describe` a small incremental `adjustment` to an `existing` plan of action. 

Keep in mind that margin means “edge,” 
so marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what you are doing. 

Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.
