in teaching entrepreneurship or writing

about entrepreneurship it's it's there's

a big challenge in it because I think

there is no single formula as you can

tell from the last few speakers it's

always a very very different story

and I think every moment in the history

of business every moment the history of

technology happens only once the next

Mark Zuckerberg will not be building a

social networking site the next Larry

Page will not be building a search

engine the next Bill Gates will not be

building an operating system company if

you're copying these people in some

sense you're not learning from them and

and this is why I think there is no

science to business
 science starts with

the number two

it starts with things that are

repeatable and experimentally verifiable

in one way or another whereas I think

you know every great company is

one-of-a-kind
