An incentive is something (such as a prospect of a `punishment` or `reward`) 
that induces a person to act. 

Because rational people make decisions by comparing costs 
and benefits, they `respond` to incentives. 

You will see that incentives play a central 
role in the study of economics. 

One economist went so far as to suggest that the 
entire field could be summarized as `simply` “People respond to incentives. The 
rest is `commentary`.”

Incentives are crucial to `analyzing` how markets work. 

For example, when the price of an apple `rises`, people decide to eat fewer apples. 

At the same time, apple `orchards` decide to hire more workers and `harvest` more apples. 

In other words, a higher price in a market provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and an 
incentive for `sellers` to produce more. 

As we will see, the influence of `prices` on the behavior of consumers and producers is crucial for how a market `economy` allocates `scarce` resources.
