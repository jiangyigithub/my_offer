As you know, many economists believe that a consumption tax would be best from the perspective of promoting economic growth—particularly if one were designing a tax system from scratch—because a consumption tax is likely to encourage saving and capital formation. However,getting from the current tax system to a consumption tax raises a challenging set of transition issues.

You may have noticed that prices often end in .99. In some ways,this phenomenon is odd. Why charge $4.99, instead of an even $5.00? If people were truly rational, sellers wouldn’t have a good reason to focus on
prices ending in .99. But in fact, it turns out that sellers are smart for using this approach to pricing. Various studies suggest that buyers are excessively sensitive to a price’s left-most digit. Even though $4.99 is only one penny less than $5.00, buyers may not perceive it that way. Because adding the extra penny changes the left-most digit from a 4 to a 5, the change may exert a surprisingly large impact on consumer behavior. An irrational focus on the left-most digit is called left-digit bias.

At low levels of production, the firm benefits from increased size because it can
take advantage of greater specialization. Coordination problems, meanwhile, are
not yet acute. By contrast, at high levels of production, the benefits of specialization
have already been realized, and coordination problems become more severe
as the firm grows larger. Thus, long-run average total cost is falling at low levels
of production because of increasing specialization and rising at high levels of production
because of the increasing prevalence of coordination problems.
