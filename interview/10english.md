题目： Towards Next-Generation Password Protocols: A Cryptographic Perspective

摘要：

Passwords have long been the most ubiquitous method of authentication on the Internet. The current password authentication approach, "password-over-TLS," suffers from three major drawbacks: (1) the security of this protocol critically relies on the assumption that the server's public key is correctly distributed to the client; (2) the server obtains the client's password in the clear upon TLS decryption;  and (3) an offline dictionary attack is inevitable upon server  compromise. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of attacks exploiting these deficiencies, leading to billions of password leakages.

In this talk, I will present two key findings from my cryptographic research towards eliminating the aforementioned weaknesses. First, I  will present a new security analysis of the highly efficient SPAKE2 password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol, showing that its security preserves under arbitrary composition. Second, I will show my  protocol OPAQUE that combines the security guarantees of PAKE and  "password-over-TLS." Overall, these results contribute to the next-generation protocols for password authentication that achieve significantly stronger security. I will conclude with my long-term vision for password protocols from a multi-angle approach that combines cryptography, security, and social sciences.
