[Thirty Years C++. Interview with Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.odbms.org/blog/2020/07/thirty-years-c-interview-with-bjarne-stroustrup/)

On my last day before leaving Cambridge after completing my thesis, he took me out to lunch and said “you are going to Bell Labs; that’s a very good place with many excellent people, but it’s also a bit of a black hole: good people go in and are never heard from again, `whatever you do, keep a high external profile.`” That fitted perfectly with my view that if you keep your good ideas to yourself, they are useless; you could just as well have been doing crossword puzzles. Only by articulating your ideas and making them accessible through writing and talks do they become a contribution.
